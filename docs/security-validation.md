# Security Validation Report: Multi-Tenant Credential Management

## Overview
This report documents the security validation performed for the multi-tenant credential management system, including penetration testing, credential storage audit, and access control review. The goal is to ensure strict tenant isolation, robust RBAC, and secure handling of sensitive data.

## 1. Penetration Testing
- **Automated E2E Tests:**
  - Playwright tests in `web2-e2e/credentials.spec.ts` simulate cross-tenant access, privilege escalation, and UI abuse cases.
  - All negative/abuse cases are blocked as expected (see test results).
- **Manual Testing:**
  - Attempted direct API and UI access to other tenants' data.
  - Attempted to bypass UI restrictions via browser dev tools and direct form submission.
  - No unauthorized access or privilege escalation was possible.

## 2. Credential Storage Audit
- All credentials are stored in the `tenant_credentials` table with enforced RLS and RBAC.
- Encryption at rest and in transit is enabled via Supabase/Postgres configuration.
- No credentials are exposed in logs, error messages, or client-side code.
- Verified that only authorized users can access or modify credentials.

## 3. Access Control Review
- RBAC is enforced in both UI and backend:
  - Only tenant admins/owners can add, edit, or delete credentials.
  - Members can only view credentials for their own tenant.
  - All actions are scoped to the current tenant context.
- RLS policies are active and tested for all multi-tenant tables.
- Automated API tests in `tests/test_tenant_credentials_rls.py` confirm that all access control rules are enforced.

## 4. Findings and Remediations
- **No critical vulnerabilities found.**
- All attempted privilege escalation and cross-tenant access were blocked.
- All credential operations are tenant-scoped and RBAC-protected.
- All sensitive data is encrypted and never exposed to unauthorized users.

## 5. Remaining Risks and Recommendations
- Ensure that all new features and tables follow the same RLS and RBAC patterns.
- Periodically review and update RLS policies as the schema evolves.
- Continue to run automated security and segregation tests as part of CI/CD.
- Consider third-party penetration testing for additional assurance.
