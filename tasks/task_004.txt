# Task ID: 4
# Title: Build Microsoft 365 and Azure Entra ID API Connectors
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop API connectors to fetch configuration data from Microsoft 365 and Azure Entra ID.
# Details:
Use Microsoft Graph API to retrieve configuration data. Implement OAuth2 authentication and token management. Handle pagination and error cases. Store retrieved data in Supabase.

# Test Strategy:
Test API authentication, data retrieval, and storage in Supabase. Validate error handling.

# Subtasks:
## 1. API Authentication Setup [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement secure authentication for the API, following best practices such as using OAuth2, API keys, or JWTs. Ensure secure storage and transmission of credentials, and implement token revocation and expiration policies.
### Details:
Research and select the appropriate authentication method for the API (e.g., OAuth2 for Microsoft Graph). Set up secure storage for API keys or tokens, enforce strong password policies if applicable, and implement mechanisms for token revocation and expiration.

## 2. Supabase Integration [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Integrate Supabase as the backend database for storing and retrieving data fetched from the external API.
### Details:
Set up Supabase project, configure tables and schemas, and establish secure connections between the application and Supabase. Ensure proper access controls and data validation.

## 3. Data Retrieval Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2
### Description: Develop logic to connect to the external API (e.g., Microsoft Graph), authenticate requests, and retrieve the required data.
### Details:
Implement API client logic to handle authentication, construct requests, and parse responses. Ensure that data is correctly mapped and stored in Supabase.

## 4. Pagination Handling [done]
### Dependencies: 4.3
### Description: Implement logic to handle paginated responses from the external API, ensuring all data is retrieved efficiently.
### Details:
Detect and process pagination tokens or next-page URLs in API responses. Loop or recursively fetch all pages of data and aggregate results before storing them in Supabase.

## 5. Error Management [done]
### Dependencies: 4.3, 4.4
### Description: Design and implement robust error handling for authentication failures, API errors, network issues, and data storage problems.
### Details:
Define error handling strategies for each failure point, including retries, logging, user feedback, and fallback mechanisms. Ensure errors are surfaced appropriately and do not compromise security or data integrity.

## 6. End-to-End Testing [done]
### Dependencies: 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5
### Description: Develop and execute comprehensive tests covering authentication, data retrieval, pagination, error handling, and Supabase integration.
### Details:
Write automated tests to simulate real-world scenarios, including successful and failed authentications, paginated data retrieval, error conditions, and data persistence in Supabase. Validate that the entire workflow operates as expected.
