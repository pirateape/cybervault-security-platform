# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement User Authentication and Role-Based Access
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop user authentication and role-based access control for the platform.
# Details:
Integrate Supabase Auth for user sign-up, sign-in, and password reset. Define roles (Security Team, Compliance Officer, Developer, IT Admin). Implement JWT-based session management and role checks on API endpoints.

# Test Strategy:
Test user registration, login, role assignment, and access control for protected endpoints.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Integrate Supabase Auth into the Application [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up Supabase Auth in the project, including installing necessary packages, configuring environment variables, and initializing Supabase clients for authentication.
### Details:
Follow Supabase documentation to install @supabase/supabase-js and configure project URL and anon key. Ensure the app can connect to Supabase and perform basic authentication flows (sign up, sign in, sign out).

## 2. Implement Role Definitions and Authorization Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Define user roles and set up authorization logic using Supabase's Row Level Security (RLS) or external tools as needed.
### Details:
Model roles in the database, create RLS policies, and optionally use tools like Permit.io for fine-grained access control. Ensure roles are assigned to users and authorization rules are enforced at the database level.

## 3. Implement Session Management [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Set up session management to handle user authentication state, token storage, and automatic refresh of sessions.
### Details:
Use Supabase Auth's session management features to track user sessions, store JWTs securely, and handle session expiration and renewal in the frontend and backend.

## 4. Secure API Endpoints Based on Roles [done]
### Dependencies: 3.2, 3.3
### Description: Protect API endpoints by verifying user authentication and enforcing role-based access control.
### Details:
Implement middleware or server-side logic to check JWTs, validate user roles, and restrict access to sensitive endpoints according to defined authorization rules.

## 5. Test Access Control and Security [done]
### Dependencies: 3.4
### Description: Thoroughly test authentication, role assignments, session handling, and access control to ensure security and correct behavior.
### Details:
Write and execute tests for various user roles and scenarios, including unauthorized access attempts, session expiration, and correct enforcement of RLS and API protections.
