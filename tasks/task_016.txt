# Task ID: 16
# Title: Optimize Performance and Scalability
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12, 14
# Priority: low
# Description: Optimize backend and frontend for large-scale enterprise use.
# Details:
Profile and optimize database queries, API endpoints, and frontend rendering. Implement caching and load balancing where needed.

# Test Strategy:
Test performance under load, measure response times, and validate scalability.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Backend Profiling [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Analyze backend system performance to identify bottlenecks, resource-intensive operations, and inefficient code paths.
### Details:
Use profiling tools to monitor CPU, memory, and I/O usage. Collect metrics on API response times and database interactions.

## 2. Query Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Optimize database queries to minimize resource usage and accelerate response times.
### Details:
Review slow queries, apply indexing strategies, restructure inefficient joins, and ensure only necessary data is retrieved. Use query analyzers and execution plans to guide improvements.

## 3. Frontend Performance Improvements [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Enhance frontend performance by reducing load times and improving responsiveness.
### Details:
Audit frontend assets, implement code splitting, optimize images, and minimize JavaScript/CSS payloads. Use browser profiling tools to identify and address bottlenecks.

## 4. Caching Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.2, 16.3
### Description: Introduce caching mechanisms to reduce redundant data processing and improve response times.
### Details:
Implement server-side and client-side caching strategies, such as in-memory caches, CDN usage, and HTTP cache headers. Determine appropriate cache invalidation policies.

## 5. Load Balancing Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.4
### Description: Configure load balancing to distribute incoming traffic evenly across backend resources.
### Details:
Set up and configure load balancers, define routing rules, and ensure session persistence as needed. Monitor load distribution and failover capabilities.

## 6. Scalability Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.5
### Description: Conduct scalability and stress testing to validate system performance under increased load.
### Details:
Simulate high-traffic scenarios, monitor system behavior, and identify any remaining bottlenecks. Use results to inform further optimization cycles.
