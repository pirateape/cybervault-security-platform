# Task ID: 8
# Title: Integrate AI-Driven Risk Analysis Microservice
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop and integrate an AI microservice for risk prediction and remediation suggestions.
# Details:
Host TensorFlow/Scikit-learn model on Azure or AWS. Expose REST API for risk analysis. Integrate with backend to process scan results and provide recommendations. Support human-in-the-loop validation.

# Test Strategy:
Test AI model integration, recommendation accuracy, and validation workflow.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Model Hosting Setup [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Deploy the AI/ML model to a scalable and secure hosting environment, ensuring proper configuration and monitoring.
### Details:
Select a cloud provider or on-premise solution, containerize the model if necessary, configure endpoints, and set up monitoring for performance and failures.

## 2. REST API Development [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Develop RESTful APIs to expose the model's inference capabilities to external clients and internal services.
### Details:
Design API endpoints, implement request/response validation, handle authentication, and ensure secure access to the model hosting endpoint.

## 3. Backend Integration [done]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Integrate the REST API with backend systems to enable seamless data flow and orchestration.
### Details:
Connect the API to databases, authentication services, and business logic layers as required by the application architecture.

## 4. Data Pipeline Setup [done]
### Dependencies: 8.3
### Description: Establish data pipelines for preprocessing, feature extraction, and feeding data into the model for inference.
### Details:
Implement ETL processes, automate data ingestion, and ensure data quality and consistency throughout the pipeline.

## 5. Recommendation Logic Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: 8.4
### Description: Develop and integrate the logic for generating recommendations based on model outputs and business rules.
### Details:
Translate model predictions into actionable recommendations, apply post-processing, and handle edge cases as per requirements.

## 6. Human-in-the-Loop Workflow Integration [done]
### Dependencies: 8.5
### Description: Incorporate mechanisms for human validation, feedback, and intervention in the recommendation process.
### Details:
Design interfaces and workflows for human reviewers, capture feedback, and enable model retraining or override as needed.

## 7. Integration Testing [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Conduct comprehensive integration testing to ensure all components work together as intended and meet quality standards.
### Details:
Develop test cases covering end-to-end scenarios, validate data flow, API responses, recommendation accuracy, and human-in-the-loop interactions.
