# Task ID: 10
# Title: Extend Scanning to Power Platform
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add support for scanning Power Apps and Power Automate workflows.
# Details:
Integrate Power Platform API to fetch workflow and app configurations. Extend scanning engine to analyze Power Platform data. Store results in Supabase.

# Test Strategy:
Test API integration, data retrieval, and scanning logic for Power Platform.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Power Platform API Integration Setup [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish integration with the Power Platform API, including authentication, endpoint configuration, and connectivity validation.
### Details:
Review API documentation, configure authentication (OAuth, API keys), and set up connection endpoints for both development and production environments.

## 2. Data Retrieval Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Develop logic to retrieve required data from the Power Platform API using appropriate HTTP methods and handle pagination if necessary.
### Details:
Implement GET requests to fetch data, handle response formats (JSON/XML), and manage pagination or filtering as per API capabilities.

## 3. Scanning Logic Extension [done]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Extend or adapt the core scanning logic to process and analyze the retrieved data according to business requirements.
### Details:
Modify or enhance existing scanning algorithms to work with the new data structures and ensure compatibility with Power Platform data models.

## 4. Result Storage Design and Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: 10.3
### Description: Design and implement a mechanism to store the results of the scanning logic in a persistent and queryable format.
### Details:
Choose appropriate storage (e.g., Dataverse, Azure SQL, Blob Storage), define schemas, and implement data writing logic.

## 5. Robust Error Handling Integration [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4
### Description: Implement comprehensive error handling for all integration points, including API failures, data inconsistencies, and storage errors.
### Details:
Capture and log errors, implement retry logic, and provide meaningful error messages for monitoring and troubleshooting.

## 6. Validation and Testing [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, 10.5
### Description: Develop and execute validation and testing procedures to ensure the integration, data retrieval, scanning, storage, and error handling work as intended.
### Details:
Create test cases for each component, perform integration and end-to-end testing, and validate data consistency and error handling.
