# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Core Compliance Scanning Engine
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the core scanning logic to detect misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.
# Details:
Create a rule engine that applies predefined compliance rules (NIST, ISO 27001, CIS Controls) to the fetched data. Store scan results in Supabase. Support basic remediation status tracking.

# Test Strategy:
Test scanning logic with sample data, validate rule application, and result storage.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Rule Engine Architecture Design [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design the overall architecture for the rule engine, including core components such as rule repository, trigger services, processing engine, and execution services. Define interfaces for extensibility and modularity.
### Details:
Establish standards for rule definition, hierarchy, and management. Specify how rules will be stored, retrieved, and versioned. Ensure the design supports scalability and maintainability.

## 2. Rule Implementation and Management [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Develop and implement the rules according to the designed architecture. Set up a central repository for rule storage and management, and define processes for rule authoring, testing, and deployment.
### Details:
Break down rules into modular, reusable components. Implement rule triggers, conditions, and actions. Establish best practices for rule optimization and monitoring.

## 3. Data Ingestion Pipeline Development [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Build a robust data ingestion pipeline to collect, validate, and preprocess input data required for rule evaluation and scan execution.
### Details:
Define supported data formats and sources. Implement data validation, transformation, and error handling mechanisms to ensure data quality and consistency.

## 4. Scan Execution Engine Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: 5.2, 5.3
### Description: Develop the scan execution engine that applies the implemented rules to ingested data, orchestrates rule evaluation, and manages execution flow.
### Details:
Ensure efficient rule execution, support for parallelism, and proper error handling. Integrate with the rule engine and data ingestion components.

## 5. Result Storage and Management [done]
### Dependencies: 5.4
### Description: Design and implement a storage solution for scan results, ensuring efficient retrieval, indexing, and historical tracking.
### Details:
Define data models for storing results, including metadata, timestamps, and rule references. Ensure compliance with data retention and security requirements.

## 6. Remediation Tracking System [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a system to track remediation actions based on scan results, including status updates, assignments, and resolution verification.
### Details:
Integrate with result storage to link findings to remediation tasks. Provide interfaces for updating and monitoring remediation progress.

## 7. Validation and Testing Framework [done]
### Dependencies: 5.2, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6
### Description: Create a comprehensive validation and testing framework to ensure correctness, performance, and reliability of the rule engine, scan execution, and result tracking.
### Details:
Develop automated test cases covering various scenarios and edge cases. Implement monitoring and reporting tools for continuous validation.
