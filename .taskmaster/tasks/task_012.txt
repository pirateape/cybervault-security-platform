# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Multi-Tenant Support and Credential Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enable organization-level isolation and secure credential management.
# Details:
Extend Supabase schema and backend logic to support multiple organizations. Implement secure credential storage and management for each tenant. Enforce strict data isolation.

# Test Strategy:
Test multi-tenant data isolation, credential management, and access control.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Schema Extension for Multi-Tenancy [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement schema changes to support multi-tenancy, selecting an appropriate pattern (e.g., separate schemas per tenant, shared schema with tenant discriminator, or separate databases) based on isolation and customization requirements.
### Details:
Evaluate business needs for data isolation and customization. Extend the database schema to support tenant identification and separation, ensuring scalability and maintainability.

## 2. Tenant Isolation Logic Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Develop application logic to enforce tenant isolation at the data access layer, ensuring that tenants can only access their own data.
### Details:
Implement middleware or query filters that restrict data access based on tenant context. Validate that isolation logic is enforced throughout the application.

## 3. Credential Storage Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Design and implement secure storage for tenant credentials, ensuring encryption at rest and in transit, and compliance with security best practices.
### Details:
Use secure vaults or encrypted storage mechanisms for credentials. Ensure credentials are never exposed in logs or error messages.

## 4. Access Control and Authorization [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.2, 12.3
### Description: Implement robust access control mechanisms, such as Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), decoupling policy schema from application data and using a centralized Policy Decision Point (PDP).
### Details:
Integrate a dedicated authorization system to manage roles and permissions. Ensure dynamic policy evaluation and consistent enforcement across all tenants.

## 5. Data Segregation Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.2, 12.4
### Description: Develop and execute tests to verify that data segregation and tenant isolation are enforced at both the schema and application levels.
### Details:
Create automated and manual test cases to simulate cross-tenant access attempts and validate that isolation mechanisms prevent data leakage.

## 6. Migration Planning [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4
### Description: Plan and document the migration process for existing data and tenants to the new multi-tenant schema, minimizing downtime and ensuring data integrity.
### Details:
Develop migration scripts, rollback strategies, and communication plans for stakeholders. Schedule and test migrations in staging environments before production rollout.

## 7. Security Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.3, 12.4, 12.5, 12.6
### Description: Conduct comprehensive security validation, including penetration testing, credential storage audits, and access control reviews to ensure compliance and robustness.
### Details:
Engage security experts to perform audits and tests. Address any vulnerabilities found and document security measures for ongoing monitoring.
