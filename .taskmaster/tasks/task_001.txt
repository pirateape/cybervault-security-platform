# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository and CI/CD Pipeline
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository and configure automated CI/CD pipeline for testing and deployment.
# Details:
Create a new repository for the project. Set up GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps for automated builds, tests, and deployments. Configure environment variables and secrets for cloud credentials. Ensure pipeline supports React 18 + TypeScript and Supabase backend.

# Test Strategy:
Verify pipeline runs on code push, executes unit tests, and deploys to staging environment.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Project Repository [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up a new project repository in the chosen version control system (e.g., GitHub, GitLab). Initialize the repository with a README and appropriate .gitignore files.
### Details:
This step establishes the foundation for source code management and collaboration. Ensure repository permissions and branch protections are configured as needed.

## 2. Configure CI/CD Tool [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Select and configure the CI/CD tool (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI). Integrate it with the project repository and install any required plugins or runners.
### Details:
Connect the repository to the CI/CD tool and verify that the tool can access the codebase. Set up basic project-level settings and permissions for the CI/CD system.

## 3. Set Up Environment Variables [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Define and securely store environment variables required for the build and deployment processes within the CI/CD tool.
### Details:
Add secrets such as API keys, database credentials, and deployment tokens to the CI/CD toolâ€™s environment variable management system. Ensure sensitive data is not exposed in logs or code.

## 4. Develop Pipeline Scripts [done]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Write and commit pipeline configuration scripts (e.g., YAML files for GitHub Actions or Jenkinsfiles) that define the build, test, and deployment stages.
### Details:
Implement scripts that automate code building, testing, and deployment. Include steps for installing dependencies, running tests, and deploying to target environments.

## 5. Verify Deployment and Pipeline Functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 1.4
### Description: Trigger the CI/CD pipeline to ensure all stages execute correctly and the application is successfully deployed to the target environment.
### Details:
Monitor pipeline runs for errors, validate deployment outcomes, and review logs to confirm that environment variables and scripts function as intended.
