# Task ID: 15
# Title: Expand Audit Trail for Comprehensive Logging
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 12
# Priority: low
# Description: Extend audit logging to cover all system actions.
# Details:
Log all system actions (API calls, rule changes, scan triggers, etc.). Ensure logs are immutable and accessible only to authorized roles.

# Test Strategy:
Test logging of all system actions, immutability, and access control.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Identify Additional Actions to Log [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review current system operations and determine which additional actions (e.g., database changes, sensitive operations) should be included in audit logs, referencing compliance and security requirements.
### Details:
Consult regulatory guidelines, internal policies, and best practices to ensure all relevant actions are captured. Document the list of new actions to be logged.

## 2. Update Logging Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Modify the existing logging implementation to capture the newly identified actions, ensuring logs are structured, meaningful, and include necessary metadata (timestamps, user IDs, event types).
### Details:
Update code to log all POST, UPDATE, PATCH, and DELETE requests as appropriate. Ensure log entries are consistent and follow established log format standards.

## 3. Ensure Log Immutability [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.2
### Description: Implement measures to protect audit logs from tampering, ensuring logs are immutable and access is controlled and monitored.
### Details:
Apply tamper-proof storage solutions, configure access controls, and enable logging of log access. Consider using append-only storage or cryptographic techniques to guarantee immutability.

## 4. Validate Access Control for Logs [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.3
### Description: Review and test access control mechanisms to ensure only authorized personnel can view or manage audit logs, and that all access is itself logged.
### Details:
Audit current permissions, update policies as needed, and perform tests to confirm that unauthorized access is prevented and all access attempts are recorded.
