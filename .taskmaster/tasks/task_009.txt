# Task ID: 9
# Title: Build Custom Rule Creation and Management Interface
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop UI and API for users to define and manage custom compliance rules.
# Details:
Use React 18 + TypeScript with Monaco Editor for rule editing. Expose API endpoints for rule CRUD operations. Store rules in Supabase. Enforce role-based access.

# Test Strategy:
Test rule creation, editing, deletion, and access control.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement UI with Monaco Editor [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a user interface for rule management using the Monaco Editor, ensuring responsive design, theme support, and integration with the application's style guide.
### Details:
Integrate Monaco Editor into the UI, enable features like syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and dark mode. Ensure the editor is responsive and matches the application's theme using Tailwind or similar frameworks.

## 2. Create API Endpoints for Rule Management [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Develop RESTful API endpoints to support CRUD operations for rules, enabling communication between the frontend and backend.
### Details:
Define endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting rules. Ensure endpoints are well-documented and follow REST conventions.

## 3. Implement Rule Storage Mechanism [done]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Set up a persistent storage solution for rules, such as a database schema or file-based storage, to support efficient retrieval and modification.
### Details:
Design the data model for rules, implement storage logic, and ensure data integrity and scalability.

## 4. Develop CRUD Logic for Rules [done]
### Dependencies: 9.3
### Description: Implement backend logic to handle create, read, update, and delete operations for rules, interfacing with the storage layer.
### Details:
Write service functions or controllers that process API requests, validate input, and interact with the rule storage mechanism.

## 5. Integrate Role-Based Access Control [done]
### Dependencies: 9.4
### Description: Add role-based access control to ensure only authorized users can perform specific CRUD operations on rules.
### Details:
Define user roles and permissions, implement middleware or guards to enforce access control on API endpoints and UI actions.

## 6. End-to-End Testing of Rule Management System [done]
### Dependencies: 9.5
### Description: Develop and execute end-to-end tests covering UI interactions, API integration, CRUD operations, and access control scenarios.
### Details:
Write automated tests simulating user workflows, validate correct behavior, and ensure security and reliability across the entire stack.
