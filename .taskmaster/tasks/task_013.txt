# Task ID: 13
# Title: Add API Access for External Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Expose API endpoints for integration with other tools and workflows.
# Details:
Develop REST API endpoints for scan triggers, rule management, and reporting. Document API for external use. Enforce authentication and rate limiting.

# Test Strategy:
Test API endpoints, authentication, and integration with external tools.

# Subtasks:
## 1. API Endpoint Development [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the required API endpoints following RESTful best practices, including proper URI structure, HTTP methods, and error handling.
### Details:
Define resource-based endpoints using clear, consistent naming conventions. Ensure endpoints use appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and provide informative error messages. Implement path and query parameters as needed for resource identification and filtering.

## 2. Authentication and Rate Limiting [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Integrate authentication mechanisms and implement rate limiting to secure the API and prevent abuse.
### Details:
Implement OAuth 2.0 or another suitable authentication protocol. Set up rate limiting to control the number of requests per user or API key, protecting against excessive usage and potential denial-of-service attacks.

## 3. API Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1, 13.2
### Description: Create comprehensive and interactive documentation for the API endpoints, usage, authentication, and error responses.
### Details:
Use OpenAPI/Swagger to generate interactive documentation. Include endpoint descriptions, request/response examples, authentication requirements, and error codes. Ensure documentation is clear and accessible for external developers.

## 4. Integration Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1, 13.2, 13.3
### Description: Develop and execute integration tests to validate API functionality, authentication, and rate limiting under realistic scenarios.
### Details:
Write automated tests covering all endpoints, authentication flows, and rate limiting logic. Test for correct responses, error handling, and edge cases. Ensure the API behaves as expected when integrated with client applications.

## 5. Security Review [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1, 13.2, 13.3, 13.4
### Description: Conduct a thorough security review of the API, including authentication, authorization, data validation, and vulnerability assessment.
### Details:
Review the API for common security risks such as injection, broken authentication, and data exposure. Validate input and output, check for proper access controls, and perform vulnerability scanning. Address any identified issues before production release.
