Testing Plan

## Unit Testing

Unit tests validate individual components of the compliance engine, AI agent, and API connectors.

### Example Scenarios

- **Mock Azure Entra ID API**: Simulate policy checks for multi-factor authentication (MFA) compliance.
- **Code Analysis Module**: Test the AI agent's ability to detect hardcoded credentials in Power Automate workflows.
- **Rule Engine**: Validate logic for NIST, ISO 27001, CIS, Essential 8 rules.
- **Custom Rule Handling**: Ensure user-defined rules are parsed and executed correctly.

#### Example Test Case

- **Input**: A Power Automate workflow with hardcoded API keys.
- **Expected Output**: The AI agent flags the workflow as non-compliant with Essential 8.
- **Reference**: See `check_mfa_compliance`, `check_encryption_policies` in [Examples.md](./Examples.md)

## Integration Testing

Integration tests ensure seamless communication between the platform and Microsoft 365, Azure, and Power Platform.

### Key Scenarios

- **Microsoft 365 Tenant Scan**: Verify detection of disabled user accounts in Exchange Online.
- **Azure Entra ID Policy Check**: Confirm identification of missing conditional access policies.
- **Power Platform Workflow Scan**: Validate detection of insecure or outdated flows.
- **Supabase Integration**: Ensure scan results and audit logs are correctly stored and retrieved.

#### Automation

- Use CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps) to run integration tests on every commit.
- Mock external APIs where possible; use test tenants for live integration.

## Security Testing

Security testing focuses on vulnerabilities in the platform's architecture and integrations.

### Approaches

- **Penetration Testing**: Simulate attacks such as SQL injection, XSS, privilege escalation.
- **API Security**: Test for rate limiting, OAuth2 authentication, and proper error handling.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Validate that users cannot access unauthorized data.
- **Data Encryption**: Ensure all sensitive data is encrypted in transit and at rest.

#### Example Test

- **Attack Vector**: Exploiting the API endpoint for Microsoft 365 data.
- **Mitigation**: Implement rate limiting and OAuth 2.0 authentication.

## Compliance Validation

The tool will undergo automated and third-party audits to ensure alignment with NIST, ISO 27001, CIS Controls, and Essential 8.

### Example Scenarios

- **NIST SP 800-53**: Validate enforcement of access control and audit logging.
- **ISO 27001**: Check for encryption policies in Microsoft 365 tenants.
- **CIS Controls**: Confirm detection of redundant/inactive user accounts in Azure Entra ID.
- **Essential 8**: Ensure patch management and software update checks are in place.

#### Automation

- Use static analysis tools and Power Platform Checker in CI pipelines.
- Schedule regular compliance scans and generate reports for auditors.

## Test Automation & Tools

- **Unit/Integration**: pytest, unittest (Python), Power Platform Checker, Microsoft Graph SDK test utilities.
- **Security**: OWASP ZAP, custom scripts, penetration testing frameworks.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, Power Platform Build Tools.
- **Reporting**: Automated generation of compliance and security reports.
