## [2024-06-XX] Robust supabase-py Exception Handling & Error Mapping

- All supabase_client .single() and .execute() calls are now wrapped in try/except for postgrest.exceptions.APIError.
- API endpoints map APIError to HTTP 404 (not found), 422 (malformed UUID), or 400 (other errors) using a helper.
- postgrest-py is now a required backend dependency (see requirements.txt).
- After this change, running pytest shows:
  - TypeError: Client.**init**() got an unexpected keyword argument 'proxy' (likely due to version conflicts between supabase-py, postgrest-py, and httpx/pydantic).

### Recommendations / Next Steps

- Pin supabase-py, postgrest-py, httpx, and pydantic to compatible versions in requirements.txt.
- Review supabase-py and postgrest-py release notes for breaking changes and compatibility.
- Re-run tests after pinning dependencies and resolve any remaining errors.
- Document all version pins and compatibility requirements in README.md and Architecture.md.
- Consider adding a requirements.lock or using pip-tools/poetry for deterministic installs.

## [2024-06-XX] supabase-py 'proxy' Error & Seeding Workaround

- Persistent error: `TypeError: Client.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'proxy'` when running seed_test_db.py.
- All recommended dependency pins (supabase==2.3.3, httpx==0.24.1, etc.) have been tried; error persists.
- **Workaround:** Use Supabase REST API (PostgREST) or Docker for seeding test data.
- [ ] Periodically check supabase-py GitHub issues for a fix or workaround.
- See README.md and Architecture.md for troubleshooting and details.

## REST API-Based Seeding (2024-06)

- [x] Add `tests/integration/seed_test_db_rest.py` for direct REST API seeding
- [x] Document usage and troubleshooting in README.md and Architecture.md
- [ ] Periodically review and update REST API seeding script for schema changes
- [ ] Ensure `requests` and `passlib[bcrypt]` are present in requirements.txt for backend/test scripts
- [ ] Add more robust error handling and idempotency as needed

## passlib/bcrypt Warning Tracking (2024-06)

- Warning: `(trapped) error reading bcrypt version` and `AttributeError: module 'bcrypt' has no attribute '__about__'` seen when running seed_test_db_rest.py.
- This is due to a change in bcrypt 4.1.0+ (removal of **about** attribute).
- **Non-fatal:** Password hashes are still generated and valid; seeding completes successfully.
- [ ] If this ever becomes fatal, pin `bcrypt<4.1.0` in requirements.txt and update passlib as needed.
- [ ] Periodically review passlib/bcrypt compatibility and update as needed.

## E2E Test Failure Troubleshooting (2024-06)

- [ ] Track and resolve E2E reliability issues as features evolve

## Critical: Backend Supabase Refactor (2024-06)

- [x] Refactor backend to use REST API (requests) for all Supabase DB access; remove all supabase-py usage/imports
- [x] Backend is currently blocked by supabase-py bug (see README.md, Architecture.md) [RESOLVED: now uses REST API]
- [x] Track upstream supabase-py issue and revisit when fixed [NO LONGER BLOCKING]

## REST API-Based Backend Access (2024-06)

- All backend database access is now performed via the Supabase REST API (PostgREST) using the Python requests library.
- supabase-py and postgrest-py are no longer used or required.
- If you see errors, check your SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_KEY, and ensure your service role key is used for backend/test scripts.
- See README.md and Architecture.md for ongoing tracking and troubleshooting.

- [ ] Add a code review checklist item to verify page/component integration patterns after major refactors.

## [2025-07] Fixed dashboard widget/heat map overlap by setting zIndex: 0 and position: 'relative' on HeatMapVisualization root Box. Added type guards for riskLevel color indexing to fix linter errors.

- [ ] Add regression/UI tests to verify correct widget/heat map stacking and layout.
- [ ] Add code review checklist item to verify z-index/layout issues after dashboard/layout changes.

## [2025-07] Implemented drag-and-drop dashboard widgets using react-grid-layout in DashboardLayoutProvider. Layout is persisted per user in localStorage. Updated documentation and dependencies.

- [ ] Add E2E/UI tests to verify widget rearrangement, layout persistence, and accessibility.
- [ ] Add code review checklist item to verify dashboard layout usability, accessibility, and persistence after changes.

## [2025-07] Fixed runtime error: ResponsiveReactGridLayout must be used as a JSX component, not a function. Added explicit type to resolve TypeScript JSX error. See code comments for details.

- [ ] Add regression test for dashboard layout integration pattern (Responsive + WidthProvider + TypeScript).
- [ ] Add error boundary for dashboard layout errors and document in Architecture.md.

## [2025-07] Fixed dashboard widget scaling: increased columns, set breakpoints, min/max widths, and unified layouts for all breakpoints. Widgets now scale more naturally and are not too narrow.

- [ ] Add regression/UI tests for responsive scaling and widget sizing at all breakpoints.
- [ ] Add code review checklist item to verify responsive layout and scaling after dashboard/layout changes.

- [x] Fixed: Wrapped UserManagement AlertDialogContent in Chakra Portal to ensure dialog visibility above dashboard grid/layout (2025-07)
- [ ] Add regression test for dashboard dialog visibility (portal/z-index/grid issues)
- [ ] Recommendation: Review all dashboard dialogs for proper portal usage and test for grid/overflow/z-index issues
- [x] Implemented scripts/reset_all_user_passwords.py for bulk user password reset in test environments (deletes and recreates all users with 'testpassword')
- [x] Documented script usage, limitations, and warnings in README.md and Architecture.md
- [ ] Recommendation: Implement a safer admin bulk password reset endpoint for future (does not delete users)
- [ ] Recommendation: Add test user management utilities for E2E/integration testing
- [x] Removed legacy scan trigger/modal code from Dashboard.tsx; scan trigger flow is now handled exclusively by ScanTriggerWidget in the dashboard layout
- [x] Documented modular, role-based dashboard widget approach in README.md and Architecture.md
- [ ] Recommendation: Periodically review dashboard widget communication and modularity for best practices and maintainability

## [2025-07] Fixed ImportError: email-validator is not installed (added with uv, ran uv pip install -r pyproject.toml)

- [ ] Add regression tests to ensure email-validator is present in requirements.txt
- [ ] Document troubleshooting and dependency in README.md and Architecture.md
- [ ] Recommendation: After migration, verify all required dependencies are present in pyproject.toml and uv.lock. If missing, use 'uv add <package>' and re-sync.

## Troubleshooting & Recommendations

- For Python dependency issues, use `uv` and ensure all packages are present in pyproject.toml and uv.lock.
- For frontend issues, ensure Node.js 18+, all dependencies installed, and environment variables set.
- For E2E, ensure dev server is running, test users/orgs/data are seeded, and Playwright config is correct.
- For dashboard layout and widget issues, see code comments and Tasks.md for zIndex, scaling, and drag-and-drop troubleshooting.
- For admin password reset, see UserManagement page and API endpoint documentation.
- For Monaco Editor integration, see CodeAnalysisEditor, AIFeedbackPanel, and backend API endpoints.
- For Windows, use PowerShell-compatible command separators (`;` instead of `&&`).
- **jose/python-jose Issue:**
  - **Root Cause:** The legacy 'jose' package is Python 2 only and incompatible with FastAPI/JWT usage. The correct package is 'python-jose[cryptography]'.
  - **Fix:** Remove 'jose' from pyproject.toml and requirements.txt. Add 'python-jose[cryptography]' instead. Run `uv pip install` to update the environment.
  - **Future Troubleshooting:** If you see SyntaxError or JWT import errors, check for the wrong 'jose' package. Always use 'python-jose'.

## Microsoft Graph Integration (Troubleshooting & Best Practices)

- Use msgraph-sdk for Microsoft Graph API access.
- Use azure-identity for authentication (recommended for most cases).
- Use msal for advanced scenarios or custom token management.
- Common error: Installing 'msgraph' or 'msgraph-core' instead of 'msgraph-sdk'.
- Checklist: Periodically audit dependencies for legacy/broken packages and auth flows.

## Supabase 406 Not Acceptable Troubleshooting (2025-07)

- 406 errors are usually caused by missing/incorrect Accept headers or using .single() when multiple rows are returned.
- All user queries use supabase-js, which sets headers correctly.
- If you see a 406, check for .single() misuse or custom HTTP requests to Supabase REST endpoints.
- No code changes required as of 2025-07; all headers are set correctly.

## Microsoft Graph Org Credential Management (Hybrid Pattern)

- [x] Create `ms_org_credentials` table in Supabase (no secrets, only secret_ref)
- [x] Enforce RLS: only org admins/owners can read/write
- [x] Store actual credentials in Azure Key Vault, referenced by secret_ref
- [x] Backend fetches secret_ref from Supabase, then credentials from Key Vault
- [x] Audit log all credential access (org_id, secret_ref, timestamp)
- [x] Never log or store secrets in Supabase
- [x] Fallback to env vars in dev mode (with warning)
- [x] Document pattern in README and Architecture.md
- [x] Reference: see ms_api.py, azure_keyvault.py, supabase/schemas/2024_ms_org_credentials.sql
