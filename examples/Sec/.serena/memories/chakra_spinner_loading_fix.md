# Chakra UI Spinner Loading Fix (2024-12)

## Issue

Chakra UI spinner with CSS class "chakra-spinner css-jmuyva" was loading persistently even when there was no activity.

## Root Cause

Race condition in `AuthContext.tsx` between the auth state change listener and loading state management:

- The `onAuthStateChange` listener was updating user state without properly managing loading state
- This caused conflicts with manual loading state management in auth functions
- Loading state could get stuck in `true` state

## Solution

Modified `frontend/src/context/AuthContext.tsx`:

1. **Removed loading state management from auth state change listener**

   - The listener now only updates user state: `setUser(session?.user ?? null)`
   - No longer interferes with loading state management

2. **Improved error handling in initial session fetch**

   - Added try-catch-finally block
   - Ensures `setLoading(false)` is always called

3. **Enhanced error handling in all auth methods**
   - Added proper try-catch-finally blocks to `signup`, `logout`, `loginWithMicrosoft`
   - Ensures loading state is always reset

## Key Changes

- Eliminated race conditions between auth state changes and loading state
- Each auth operation manages its own loading state independently
- Proper error handling prevents loading state from getting stuck
- Maintains existing functionality while fixing the persistent spinner issue

## Testing

To verify the fix:

1. Run `cd frontend && npm run dev`
2. Navigate through the app (login, dashboard, user management)
3. Verify that spinners only appear during actual loading operations
4. Check that spinners disappear after operations complete

## Files Modified

- `frontend/src/context/AuthContext.tsx` - AuthProvider component
