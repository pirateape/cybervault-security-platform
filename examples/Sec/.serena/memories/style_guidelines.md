# Style Guidelines & Best Practices

- Use modular, reusable components (frontend)
- Use type hints and docstrings (backend)
- Use Zod for schema validation (frontend)
- Use React Context for state (frontend)
- Use fixtures/mocks for backend tests
- All PK/FK fields must be valid UUIDs
- Never expose secrets to the client
- Use Prettier and ESLint for formatting/linting
- Use Conventional Commits for PRs
- Store service keys securely (not in git)
- Wait for async state in E2E tests
- Use robust error handling and display
- RBAC enforced for all destructive actions
