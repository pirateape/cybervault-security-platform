# AuthContext Syntax Error Resolution (2024-12)

## Issue

Persistent Vite compilation error in `frontend/src/context/AuthContext.tsx`:

```
> 30 | export const export const AuthProvider = ({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) => {
```

## Root Cause

- Duplicate "export const" declaration on line 30
- Malformed code with extra closing tags at end of file
- Inconsistent indentation throughout the component
- Previous regex and symbol replacement attempts failed to properly fix the syntax

## Solution Applied

**Complete file rewrite using `create_text_file`**:

1. Completely overwrote the file with correct syntax and formatting
2. Ensured single "export const AuthProvider" declaration
3. Applied consistent 2-space indentation throughout
4. Preserved all loading state management improvements from the original spinner fix
5. Removed all malformed code and extra closing tags

## Key Changes

- ✅ Fixed duplicate export declaration: `export const AuthProvider` (single)
- ✅ Proper TypeScript/React formatting with consistent indentation
- ✅ Clean file structure with no syntax errors
- ✅ Preserved all functionality including the spinner loading state fix

## Resolution Method

- **Tool Used**: `mcp_serena_create_text_file` (complete file overwrite)
- **Why This Worked**: Previous regex/symbol replacements failed; complete rewrite ensured clean syntax
- **Files Modified**: `frontend/src/context/AuthContext.tsx`

## Testing

After fix, the application should:

1. Compile without Vite syntax errors
2. Run successfully with `npm run dev`
3. Display proper loading states (no persistent spinners)
4. Maintain all authentication functionality

## Lessons Learned

- For complex syntax errors with multiple issues, complete file rewrite is more reliable than incremental fixes
- Always verify file state after attempted fixes
- `create_text_file` is the most reliable tool for ensuring exact file content
