The 'Trigger Scan' button in ScanTriggerWidget is correctly wired to open ScanTriggerModal. The modal contains its own 'Trigger Scan' button that performs the scan action. If the dashboard is not showing the modal, check for context, props, or layout issues in DashboardLayoutProvider or parent components. The widget and modal logic are implemented and should work if rendered and not blocked by layout or state.
