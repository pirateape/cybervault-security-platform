Frontend integration for Monaco Editor API is complete. CodeAnalysisEditor uses useCodeAnalysis to call /api/code-analysis, and AIFeedbackPanel uses useAIFeedback to call /api/ai-feedback. Both use AuthContext for user context, handle loading and error states, and display results. All mock data usage is removed. All types are TypeScript-safe. Next: update documentation and tracking files, and add any new recommendations to Tasks.md.
