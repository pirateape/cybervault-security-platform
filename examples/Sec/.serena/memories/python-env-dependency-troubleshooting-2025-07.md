2025-07: Added comprehensive troubleshooting for Python environment and dependency issues (esp. ImportError: email-validator) to README.md, Architecture.md, and Tasks.md. Added regression checklist and proposed Makefile/script target for environment diagnostics. requirements.txt is now deprecated and only present for compatibility; pyproject.toml and uv.lock are the source of truth. Recurring QA: After any dependency or environment change, run diagnostics and verify all required packages are present in the correct environment. Add new troubleshooting steps to documentation as new issues are discovered.
