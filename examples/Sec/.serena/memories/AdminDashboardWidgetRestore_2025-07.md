Restored the full widget set (scan_trigger, compliance_score, heat_map, reporting, scan_results) for the admin role in DashboardLayoutProvider.tsx. This corrects a recent regression where only the scan_trigger widget was present. All widgets should now render for admin users as intended. Documentation and tracking files will be updated to reflect this fix and add regression/code review checklist items.
