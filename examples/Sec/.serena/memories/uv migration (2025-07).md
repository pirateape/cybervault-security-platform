- Migrated Python dependency management to uv (pyproject.toml, uv.lock).
- Installed uv, initialized project files, and imported requirements.txt.
- Updated README.md and Architecture.md with uv usage and migration instructions.
- Removed requirements.txt to enforce new workflow.
- Updated Tasks.md with migration checklist and recommendations.
- Updated CI/CD and developer workflow to use uv.
- Recommendation: Periodically run `uv update` and review `uv.lock` for dependency freshness.
