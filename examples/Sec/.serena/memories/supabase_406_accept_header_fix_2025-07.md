Reviewed all Supabase client and custom HTTP request code. All user table queries use the official supabase-js client, which sets Accept headers correctly. No custom fetch/axios calls to Supabase REST endpoints were found. 406 errors can occur if .single() is used but the query returns multiple rows. Added best practices and troubleshooting notes to documentation. No code changes required at this time.
